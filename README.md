  <summary>🤓 <strong>My Personal Story</strong></summary>

I grew up on an Amstrad, thanks to my dad, and never stopped building. In grad school I specialized in NLP and built crawlers for research. That’s where I learned how much extraction matters.

In 2023, I needed web-to-Markdown. The “open source” option wanted an account, API token, and $16, and still under-delivered. I went turbo anger mode, built Crawl4AI in days, and it went viral. Now it’s the most-starred crawler on GitHub.

I made it open source for **availability**, anyone can use it without a gate. Now I’m building the platform for **affordability**, anyone can run serious crawls without breaking the bank. If that resonates, join in, send feedback, or just crawl something amazing.

2. Run a simple web crawl with Python:
```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import *

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.nbcnews.com/business",
        )
        print(result.markdown)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

3. Or use the new command-line interface:
```bash
# Basic crawl with markdown output
crwl https://www.nbcnews.com/business -o markdown

# Deep crawl with BFS strategy, max 10 pages
crwl https://docs.crawl4ai.com --deep-crawl bfs --max-pages 10

# Use LLM extraction with a specific question
crwl https://www.example.com/products -q "Extract all product prices"
```

## Installation 🛠️

Crawl4AI offers flexible installation options to suit various use cases. You can install it as a Python package or use Docker.

<details>
<summary>🐍 <strong>Using pip</strong></summary>

Choose the installation option that best fits your needs:

### Basic Installation

For basic web crawling and scraping tasks:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
crawl4ai-setup # Setup the browser
```

By default, this will install the asynchronous version of Crawl4AI, using Playwright for web crawling.

👉 **Note**: When you install Crawl4AI, the `crawl4ai-setup` should automatically install and set up Playwright. However, if you encounter any Playwright-related errors, you can manually install it using one of these methods:

1. Through the command line:

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

2. If the above doesn't work, try this more specific command:

   ```bash
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

This second method has proven to be more reliable in some cases.

---

### Installation with Synchronous Version

The sync version is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. If you need the synchronous version using Selenium:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai[sync]
```

---

### Development Installation

For contributors who plan to modify the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai.git
cd crawl4ai
pip install -e .                    # Basic installation in editable mode
```

Install optional features:

```bash
pip install -e ".[torch]"           # With PyTorch features
pip install -e ".[transformer]"     # With Transformer features
pip install -e ".[cosine]"          # With cosine similarity features
pip install -e ".[sync]"            # With synchronous crawling (Selenium)
pip install -e ".[all]"             # Install all optional features
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🐳 <strong>Docker Deployment</strong></summary>

> 🚀 **Now Available!** Our completely redesigned Docker implementation is here! This new solution makes deployment more efficient and seamless than ever.

### New Docker Features

# Visit the playground at http://localhost:11235/playground
```

### Quick Test

Run a quick test (works for both Docker options):

```python
import requests

# Submit a crawl job
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11235/crawl",
    json={"urls": ["https://example.com"], "priority": 10}
)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Crawl job submitted successfully.")
    
if "results" in response.json():
    results = response.json()["results"]
    print("Crawl job completed. Results:")
    for result in results:
        print(result)
else:
    task_id = response.json()["task_id"]
    print(f"Crawl job submitted. Task ID:: {task_id}")
    result = requests.get(f"http://localhost:11235/task/{task_id}")
```

      result = await crawler.arun("https://protected-site.com")
  # Successfully bypass Cloudflare, Akamai, and custom bot detection
  ```

- **🎨 Multi-URL Configuration**: Different strategies for different URL patterns in one batch:
  ```python
  from crawl4ai import CrawlerRunConfig, MatchMode
  
  configs = [
      # Documentation sites - aggressive caching
      CrawlerRunConfig(
          url_matcher=["*docs*", "*documentation*"],
          cache_mode="write",
          markdown_generator_options={"include_links": True}
      ),
      
      # News/blog sites - fresh content
      CrawlerRunConfig(
          url_matcher=lambda url: 'blog' in url or 'news' in url,
          cache_mode="bypass"
      ),
      
      # Fallback for everything else
      CrawlerRunConfig()
  ]
  
  results = await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=configs)
  # Each URL gets the perfect configuration automatically
  ```

- **🧠 Memory Monitoring**: Track and optimize memory usage during crawling:
  ```python

<summary><strong>Version 0.7.0 Release Highlights - The Adaptive Intelligence Update</strong></summary>

- **🧠 Adaptive Crawling**: Your crawler now learns and adapts to website patterns automatically:
  ```python
  config = AdaptiveConfig(
      confidence_threshold=0.7, # Min confidence to stop crawling
      max_depth=5, # Maximum crawl depth
      max_pages=20, # Maximum number of pages to crawl
      strategy="statistical"
  )
  
  async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
      adaptive_crawler = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
      state = await adaptive_crawler.digest(
          start_url="https://news.example.com",
          query="latest news content"
      )
  # Crawler learns patterns and improves extraction over time
  ```

- **🌊 Virtual Scroll Support**: Complete content extraction from infinite scroll pages:
  ```python
  scroll_config = VirtualScrollConfig(
      container_selector="[data-testid='feed']",
      scroll_count=20,
      scroll_by="container_height",
      wait_after_scroll=1.0
  )
  
  result = await crawler.arun(url, config=CrawlerRunConfig(
      virtual_scroll_config=scroll_config
  ))
  ```

- **🔗 Intelligent Link Analysis**: 3-layer scoring system for smart link prioritization:
  ```python
  link_config = LinkPreviewConfig(
      query="machine learning tutorials",
      score_threshold=0.3,
      concurrent_requests=10
  )
  
  result = await crawler.arun(url, config=CrawlerRunConfig(
      link_preview_config=link_config,
      score_links=True
  ))
  # Links ranked by relevance and quality
  ```

- **🎣 Async URL Seeder**: Discover thousands of URLs in seconds:
  ```python
  seeder = AsyncUrlSeeder(SeedingConfig(
      source="sitemap+cc",
      pattern="*/blog/*",
      query="python tutorials",
      score_threshold=0.4
  ))
  
  urls = await seeder.discover("https://example.com")
  ```

- **⚡ Performance Boost**: Up to 3x faster with optimized resource handling and memory efficiency

## Version Numbering in Crawl4AI

Crawl4AI follows standard Python version numbering conventions (PEP 440) to help users understand the stability and features of each release.

<details>
<summary>📈 <strong>Version Numbers Explained</strong></summary>

Our version numbers follow this pattern: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 0.4.3)

#### Pre-release Versions
We use different suffixes to indicate development stages:

- `dev` (0.4.3dev1): Development versions, unstable
- `a` (0.4.3a1): Alpha releases, experimental features
- `b` (0.4.3b1): Beta releases, feature complete but needs testing
- `rc` (0.4.3): Release candidates, potential final version

#### Installation
- Regular installation (stable version):
  ```bash
  pip install -U crawl4ai
  ```

- Install pre-release versions:
  ```bash
  pip install crawl4ai --pre
  ```

- Install specific version:
  ```bash
  pip install crawl4ai==0.4.3b1
  ```

#### Why Pre-releases?
We use pre-releases to:
- Test new features in real-world scenarios
- Gather feedback before final releases
- Ensure stability for production users
- Allow early adopters to try new features

For production environments, we recommend using the stable version. For testing new features, you can opt-in to pre-releases using the `--pre` flag.
