- Removed commented-out and unused code for better readability.
- Added default value for `delay_before_return_html` parameter.

#### **Optimizations**
- Reduced resource usage in `light_mode` by disabling unnecessary browser features such as extensions, background timers, and sync.
- Improved compatibility for different browser types (`chrome`, `firefox`, `webkit`).

---

### **File: `docs/examples/quickstart_async.py`**

#### **Schema Adjustment**
- Changed schema reference for `LLMExtractionStrategy`:
  - **Old**: `OpenAIModelFee.schema()`
  - **New**: `OpenAIModelFee.model_json_schema()`
  - This likely ensures better compatibility with the `OpenAIModelFee` class and its JSON schema.

#### **Documentation Comments Updated**
- Improved extraction instruction for schema-based LLM strategies.

---

### **New Features Added**
1. **Text-Only Mode**:
   - Focuses on minimal resource usage by disabling non-essential browser features.
2. **Light Mode**:
   - Optimizes browser for performance by disabling background tasks and unnecessary services.
3. **Full Page Scanning**:
   - Ensures the entire content of a page is crawled, including dynamic elements loaded during scrolling.
4. **Dynamic Viewport Adjustment**:
   - Automatically resizes the viewport to match content dimensions, improving compatibility and rendering accuracy.
5. **Session Management**:
   - Simplifies session handling with better support for persistent and non-persistent contexts.

---

### **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed potential viewport mismatches by ensuring consistent use of `self.viewport_width` and `self.viewport_height` throughout the code.
- Improved robustness of dynamic content loading to avoid timeouts and failed evaluations.

## [0.3.74] November 17, 2024

This changelog details the updates and changes introduced in Crawl4AI version 0.3.74. It's designed to inform developers about new features, modifications to existing components, removals, and other important information.

### 1. File Download Processing

- Users can now specify download folders using the `downloads_path` parameter in the `AsyncWebCrawler` constructor or the `arun` method. If not specified, downloads are saved to a "downloads" folder within the `.crawl4ai` directory.
- File download tracking is integrated into the `CrawlResult` object.  Successfully downloaded files are listed in the `downloaded_files` attribute, providing their paths.
- Added `accept_downloads` parameter to the crawler strategies (defaults to `False`). If set to True you can add JS code and `wait_for` parameter for file download.

**Example:**

```python
import asyncio
import os
from pathlib import Path
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def download_example():
    downloads_path = os.path.join(Path.home(), ".crawl4ai", "downloads")
    os.makedirs(downloads_path, exist_ok=True)

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(
        accept_downloads=True, 
        downloads_path=downloads_path, 
        verbose=True
    ) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.python.org/downloads/",
            js_code="""
                const downloadLink = document.querySelector('a[href$=".exe"]');
                if (downloadLink) { downloadLink.click(); }
            """,
            wait_for=5 # To ensure download has started
        )

        if result.downloaded_files:
            print("Downloaded files:")
            for file in result.downloaded_files:
                print(f"- {file}")

asyncio.run(download_example())

```

### 2. Refined Content Filtering

- Introduced the `RelevanceContentFilter` strategy (and its implementation `BM25ContentFilter`) for extracting relevant content from web pages, replacing Fit Markdown and other content cleaning strategy. This new strategy leverages the BM25 algorithm to identify chunks of text relevant to the page's title, description, keywords, or a user-provided query.
- The `fit_markdown` flag in the content scraper is used to filter content based on title, meta description, and keywords.

**Example:**

```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import BM25ContentFilter

async def filter_content(url, query):
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        content_filter = BM25ContentFilter(user_query=query)
        result = await crawler.arun(url=url, extraction_strategy=content_filter, fit_markdown=True)
        print(result.extracted_content)  # Or result.fit_markdown for the markdown version
        print(result.fit_html) # Or result.fit_html to show HTML with only the filtered content

asyncio.run(filter_content("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple", "fruit nutrition health"))
```

### 3. Raw HTML and Local File Support

- Added support for crawling local files and raw HTML content directly.
- Use the `file://` prefix for local file paths.
- Use the `raw:` prefix for raw HTML strings.

**Example:**

```python
async def crawl_local_or_raw(crawler, content, content_type):
    prefix = "file://" if content_type == "local" else "raw:"
    url = f"{prefix}{content}"
    result = await crawler.arun(url=url)
    if result.success:
        print(f"Markdown Content from {content_type.title()} Source:")
        print(result.markdown)

# Example usage with local file and raw HTML
async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Local File
        await crawl_local_or_raw(
            crawler, os.path.abspath('tests/async/sample_wikipedia.html'), "local"
        )
        # Raw HTML
        await crawl_raw_html(crawler, "<h1>Raw Test</h1><p>This is raw HTML.</p>")
        

asyncio.run(main())
```

### 4. Browser Management

- New asynchronous crawler strategy implemented using Playwright.
- `ManagedBrowser` class introduced for improved browser session handling, offering features like persistent browser sessions between requests (using  `session_id`  parameter) and browser process monitoring.
- Updated to tf-playwright-stealth for enhanced stealth capabilities.
- Added `use_managed_browser`, `use_persistent_context`, and `chrome_channel` parameters to AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy.


**Example:**
```python
async def browser_management_demo():
    user_data_dir = os.path.join(Path.home(), ".crawl4ai", "user-data-dir")
    os.makedirs(user_data_dir, exist_ok=True)  # Ensure directory exists
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(
        use_managed_browser=True,
        user_data_dir=user_data_dir,
        use_persistent_context=True,
        verbose=True
    ) as crawler:
        result1 = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com", session_id="my_session"
        )
        result2 = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com/anotherpage", session_id="my_session"
        )

asyncio.run(browser_management_demo())
```


### 5. API Server & Cache Improvements

- Added CORS support to API server.
- Implemented static file serving.
- Enhanced root redirect functionality.
- Cache database updated to store response headers and downloaded files information. It utilizes a file system approach to manage large content efficiently.
- New, more efficient caching database built using xxhash and file system approach.
- Introduced `CacheMode` enum (`ENABLED`, `DISABLED`, `READ_ONLY`, `WRITE_ONLY`, `BYPASS`) and `always_bypass_cache` parameter in AsyncWebCrawler for fine-grained cache control. This replaces `bypass_cache`, `no_cache_read`, `no_cache_write`, and `always_by_pass_cache`.


### üóëÔ∏è Removals

- Removed deprecated: `crawl4ai/content_cleaning_strategy.py`.
- Removed internal class ContentCleaningStrategy
- Removed legacy cache control flags:  `bypass_cache`,  `disable_cache`,  `no_cache_read`,  `no_cache_write`, and `always_by_pass_cache`.  These have been superseded by  `cache_mode`.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Other Changes

- Moved version file to `crawl4ai/__version__.py`.
- Added `crawl4ai/cache_context.py`.
- Added `crawl4ai/version_manager.py`.
- Added `crawl4ai/migrations.py`.
- Added `crawl4ai-migrate` entry point.
- Added config `NEED_MIGRATION` and `SHOW_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS`.
- API server now requires an API token for authentication, configurable with the `CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN` environment variable.  This enhances API security.
- Added synchronous crawl endpoint `/crawl_sync` for immediate result retrieval, and direct crawl endpoint `/crawl_direct` bypassing the task queue.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Notices

- The synchronous version of `WebCrawler` is being phased out.  While still available via `crawl4ai[sync]`, it will eventually be removed. Transition to `AsyncWebCrawler` is strongly recommended. Boolean cache control flags in `arun` are also deprecated, migrate to using the `cache_mode` parameter.  See examples in the "New Features" section above for correct usage.


### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Resolved issue with browser context closing unexpectedly in Docker. This significantly improves stability, particularly within containerized environments. 
- Fixed memory leaks associated with incorrect asynchronous cleanup by removing the `__del__` method and ensuring the browser context is closed explicitly using context managers.
- Improved error handling in `WebScrapingStrategy`. More detailed error messages and suggestions for debugging will minimize frustration when running into unexpected issues.
- Fixed issue with incorrect text parsing in specific HTML structures.


### Example of migrating to the new CacheMode:

**Old way:**

```python
crawler = AsyncWebCrawler(always_by_pass_cache=True)
result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", bypass_cache=True)
```

**New way:**

```python
from crawl4ai import CacheMode

crawler = AsyncWebCrawler(always_bypass_cache=True)
result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS)
```
