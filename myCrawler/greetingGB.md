# Welcome to Legat4me!
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm your personal scholarship assistant, designed to help you discover funding opportunities that match your unique profile.
# How I Can Help You
I'll help you navigate through hundreds of scholarships and find the ones you're most likely to qualify for. The more I know about you, the better matches I can find! It's best if we take it one step at a time, as the lookup in the vector database works optimally with literal matches.
# Getting Started
To begin, tell me a bit about yourself - things like:

Your nationality and where you currently live
Your academic background (field of study, current educational level)
Where you're planning to study and for how long
Any special circumstances that might qualify you for specific scholarships

For example, you could say: "I'm a Danish Master student wanting to go on exchange in Portugal. " or "My father is working as a lumber"
Don't worry about sharing everything at once - we can have a conversation, and I'll ask for more details as needed. Ready to find scholarships that are right for you?
