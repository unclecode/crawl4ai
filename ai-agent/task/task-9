### Task 9: Create caching layer with Redis

**Description:**

```
This task involves implementing a `CacheManager` class to reduce redundant crawls. The manager will:
- Implement URL-based caching using Redis, with URL hashing for keys.
- Manage Time-To-Live (TTL) for cache entries based on user tier or content type.
- Provide logic for cache invalidation and cleanup.
- Track cache hit/miss ratios for metrics.
```
