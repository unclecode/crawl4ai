Task 7: Implement content extraction and cleaning
Description:
This task involves creating a `ContentExtractor` class to process the raw HTML fetched by the crawler. Using `BeautifulSoup4`, this class will clean the HTML by removing non-essential elements like navigation, headers, footers, and scripts. It will also implement a content quality scoring algorithm and a minimum word count validation to ensure the extracted text is meaningful. Unit tests will validate the extraction and scoring logic.

7. Implement content extraction and cleaning
- Create ContentExtractor class using BeautifulSoup4
- Implement removal of navigation, headers, footers, and script elements
- Add content quality scoring algorithm based on word count and structure
- Create fallback extraction methods for different content types
- Implement minimum word count validation
- Write unit tests for content extraction and quality scoring
Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4
