Task 8: Add markdown conversion and formatting
Description:

This task is to convert the cleaned HTML content into well-formatted markdown. We will use a library like `html2text` as a base and then implement custom logic to ensure the output has clean headings, structure, and readability. This includes preserving metadata, adding citation hints, and analyzing the content structure for optimal formatting. Unit tests will verify the quality and correctness of the markdown conversion.
