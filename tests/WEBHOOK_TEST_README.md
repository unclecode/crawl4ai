# Webhook Feature Test Script

This directory contains a comprehensive test script for the webhook feature implementation.

## Overview

The `test_webhook_feature.sh` script automates the entire process of testing the webhook feature:

1. ‚úÖ Fetches and switches to the webhook feature branch
2. ‚úÖ Activates the virtual environment
3. ‚úÖ Installs all required dependencies
4. ‚úÖ Starts Redis server in background
5. ‚úÖ Starts Crawl4AI server in background
6. ‚úÖ Runs webhook integration test
7. ‚úÖ Verifies job completion via webhook
8. ‚úÖ Cleans up and returns to original branch

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment already created (`venv/` in project root)
- Git repository with the webhook feature branch
- `redis-server` (script will attempt to install if missing)
- `curl` and `lsof` commands available

## Usage

### Quick Start

From the project root:

```bash
./tests/test_webhook_feature.sh
```

Or from the tests directory:

```bash
cd tests
./test_webhook_feature.sh
```

### What the Script Does

#### Step 1: Branch Management
- Saves your current branch
- Fetches the webhook feature branch from remote
- Switches to the webhook feature branch

#### Step 2: Environment Setup
- Activates your existing virtual environment
- Installs dependencies from `deploy/docker/requirements.txt`
- Installs Flask for the webhook receiver

#### Step 3: Service Startup
- Starts Redis server on port 6379
- Starts Crawl4AI server on port 11235
- Waits for server health check to pass

#### Step 4: Webhook Test
- Creates a webhook receiver on port 8080
- Submits a crawl job for `https://example.com` with webhook config
- Waits for webhook notification (60s timeout)
- Verifies webhook payload contains expected data

#### Step 5: Cleanup
- Stops webhook receiver
- Stops Crawl4AI server
- Stops Redis server
- Returns to your original branch

## Troubleshooting

### Server Failed to Start

If the server fails to start, check the logs:

```bash
tail -100 /tmp/crawl4ai_server.log
```

Common issues:
- Port 11235 already in use: `lsof -ti:11235 | xargs kill -9`
- Missing dependencies: Check that all packages are installed

### Redis Connection Failed

Check if Redis is running:

```bash
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

If not running:

```bash
redis-server --port 6379 --daemonize yes
```

### Webhook Not Received

The script has a 60-second timeout for webhook delivery. If the webhook isn't received:

1. Check server logs: `/tmp/crawl4ai_server.log`
2. Verify webhook receiver is running on port 8080
3. Check network connectivity between components

### Script Interruption

If the script is interrupted (Ctrl+C), cleanup happens automatically via trap. The script will:
- Kill all background processes
- Stop Redis
- Return to your original branch

To manually cleanup if needed:

```bash
# Kill processes by port
lsof -ti:11235 | xargs kill -9  # Server
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9   # Webhook receiver
lsof -ti:6379 | xargs kill -9   # Redis

# Return to your branch
git checkout develop  # or your branch name
```

## Testing Different URLs

To test with a different URL, modify the script or create a custom test:

```python
payload = {
    "urls": ["https://your-url-here.com"],
    "browser_config": {"headless": True},
    "crawler_config": {"cache_mode": "bypass"},
    "webhook_config": {
        "webhook_url": "http://localhost:8080/webhook",
        "webhook_data_in_payload": True
    }
}
```

## Files Generated

The script creates temporary files:

- `/tmp/crawl4ai_server.log` - Server output logs
- `/tmp/test_webhook.py` - Webhook test Python script

These are not cleaned up automatically so you can review them after the test.

## Exit Codes

- `0` - All tests passed successfully
- `1` - Test failed (check output for details)

## Safety Features

- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup on exit, interrupt, or error
- ‚úÖ Returns to original branch on completion
- ‚úÖ Kills all background processes
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Colored output for easy reading
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging at each step

## Notes

- The script uses `set -e` to exit on any command failure
- All background processes are tracked and cleaned up
- The virtual environment must exist before running
- Redis must be available (installed or installable via apt-get/brew)

## Integration with CI/CD

This script can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Test Webhook Feature
  run: |
    chmod +x tests/test_webhook_feature.sh
    ./tests/test_webhook_feature.sh
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review server logs at `/tmp/crawl4ai_server.log`
3. Ensure all prerequisites are met
4. Open an issue with the full output of the script
