   - Export as Python code, JSON schema, or markdown

### Running the Generated Code

The downloaded Python file contains:

```python
# 1. The HTML snippet of your selected container
HTML_SNIPPET = """..."""

# 2. The extraction query based on your selections
EXTRACTION_QUERY = """..."""

# 3. Functions to generate and test the schema
async def generate_schema():
    # Generates the extraction schema using LLM
    
async def test_extraction():
    # Tests the schema on the actual website
```

To use it:

1. Install Crawl4AI: `pip install crawl4ai`
2. Run the script: `python crawl4ai_schema_*.py`
3. The script will generate a `generated_schema.json` file
4. Use this schema in your Crawl4AI projects!
