## 🎯 How to Use

### Building a Schema

1. **Navigate to any website** you want to extract data from
2. **Click the Crawl4AI extension icon** in your toolbar
3. **Click "Schema Builder"** to start the capture mode
4. **Select a container element**:
   - Hover over elements (they'll highlight in blue)
   - Click on a repeating container (e.g., product card, article block)
5. **Select fields within the container**:
   - Elements will now highlight in green
   - Click on each piece of data you want to extract
   - Name each field (e.g., "title", "price", "description")
6. **Generate the code**:
   - Click "Generate Code" in the extension popup
   - A Python file will automatically download

### Running the Generated Code

The downloaded Python file contains:

```python
# 1. The HTML snippet of your selected container
HTML_SNIPPET = """..."""

# 2. The extraction query based on your selections
EXTRACTION_QUERY = """..."""

# 3. Functions to generate and test the schema
async def generate_schema():
    # Generates the extraction schema using LLM
    
async def test_extraction():
    # Tests the schema on the actual website
```

To use it:

1. Install Crawl4AI: `pip install crawl4ai`
2. Run the script: `python crawl4ai_schema_*.py`
3. The script will generate a `generated_schema.json` file
4. Use this schema in your Crawl4AI projects!
