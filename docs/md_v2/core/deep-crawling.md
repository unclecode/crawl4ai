# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy  
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output  
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content  
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls  
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization  

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../core/simple-crawling.md) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )
    
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun("https://example.com", config=config)
        
        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")
        
        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
  - Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
  - Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```python
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Maximum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Maximum score for URLs to be crawled (default: infinite)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```python
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Maximum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Maximum score for URLs to be crawled (default: infinite)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```python
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```python
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun("https://example.com", config=config)
    
    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```python
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun("https://example.com", config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```python
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```python
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),
    
    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),
    
    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

- **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
- **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
- **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
- **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
- **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

---

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```python
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun("https://example.com", config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```python
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```python
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content
- It's a BM25-based relevance filter using head section content

---

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),
        
        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),
        
        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in await crawler.arun("https://docs.example.com", config=config):
            results.append(result)
            score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
            depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
            print(f"Depth: {depth} | Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")

    # Analyze the results
    print(f"Crawled {len(results)} high-value pages")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(r.metadata.get('score', 0) for r in results) / len(results):.2f}")

    # Group by depth
    depth_counts = {}
    for result in results:
        depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
        depth_counts[depth] = depth_counts.get(depth, 0) + 1

    print("Pages crawled by depth:")
    for depth, count in sorted(depth_counts.items()):
        print(f"  Depth {depth}: {count} pages")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_advanced_crawler())
```

---


## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```python
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score_threshold

The score ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing the best possible value.
For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a maximum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```python
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores above this value
)
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.**  Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)
  
4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

5.**Balance breadth vs. depth.** Choose your strategy wisely - BFS for comprehensive coverage, DFS for deep exploration, BestFirst for focused relevance-based crawling.
