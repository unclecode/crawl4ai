> **Note**: If you're looking for the old documentation, you can access it [here](https://old.docs.crawl4ai.com).

## ðŸŽ¯ New: Adaptive Web Crawling

Crawl4AI now features intelligent adaptive crawling that knows when to stop! Using advanced information foraging algorithms, it determines when sufficient information has been gathered to answer your query.

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to show you how easy it is to use Crawl4AI with its asynchronous capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    # Create an instance of AsyncWebCrawler
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Run the crawler on a URL
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://crawl4ai.com")

        # Print the extracted content
        print(result.markdown)

# Run the async main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## What Does Crawl4AI Do?

Crawl4AI is a feature-rich crawler and scraper that aims to:

1.â€€**Generate Clean Markdown**: Perfect for RAG pipelines or direct ingestion into LLMs.  
2.â€€**Structured Extraction**: Parse repeated patterns with CSS, XPath, or LLM-based extraction.  
3.â€€**Advanced Browser Control**: Hooks, proxies, stealth modes, session re-useâ€”fine-grained control.  
4.â€€**High Performance**: Parallel crawling, chunk-based extraction, real-time use cases.  
5.â€€**Open Source**: No forced API keys, no paywallsâ€”everyone can access their data.  

**Core Philosophies**:
- **Democratize Data**: Free to use, transparent, and highly configurable.  
- **LLM Friendly**: Minimally processed, well-structured text, images, and metadata, so AI models can easily consume it.
