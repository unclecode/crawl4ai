    "When to Use Session-Based Crawling: \n",
    "Session-based crawling is especially beneficial when navigating through multi-page content where each page load needs to maintain the same session context. For instance, in cases where a ‚ÄúNext Page‚Äù button must be clicked to load subsequent data, the new data often replaces the previous content. Here, session-based crawling keeps the browser state intact across each interaction, allowing for sequential actions within the same session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Multi-Page Navigation Using JavaScript\n",
    "In this example, we‚Äôll navigate through multiple pages by clicking a \"Next Page\" button. After each page load, we extract the new content and repeat the process."

Even so, 64% of consumers said they noticed price increases at quick-service restaurants in September, more than at any other type of venue, according to a survey by Datassential, a food and beverage market researcher. Politicians are still drawing attention to fast-food costs, too, as the election season barrels toward a tumultuous finish. A group of Democratic senators this month [denounced McDonald‚Äôs for menu prices](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/democratic-senators-slam-mcdonalds-menu-price-hikes-rcna176380) that they said outstripped inflation, accusing the company of looking to profit ‚Äúat the expense of people‚Äôs ability to put food on the table.‚Äù The financial results come toward the end of a humbling year for the nearly $213 billion restaurant chain, whose shares remained steady on the heels of its latest earnings. Kempczinski [sought to reassure investors](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-ceo-comments.html) that [the E. coli outbreak](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/illnesses-linked-mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-rise-75-cdc-says-rcna177260), linked to Quarter Pounder burgers, was under control after the health crisis temporarily dented the company‚Äôs stock and caused U.S. foot traffic to drop nearly 10% in the days afterward, according to estimates by Gordon Haskett financial researchers.

Going forward, McDonald‚Äôs would be ‚Äúlaser-focused‚Äù on affordability.  ‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs has also done a good job of embedding the brand in popular culture to enhance its relevance and meaning around fun and family.
