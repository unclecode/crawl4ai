The methods section also serves as a blueprint for the study, helping other researchers replicate the findings and advance scientific knowledge.

  YOUR REVISION
  \`\`\`

- Methods should be written with a focus on reproducible procedures. 
- Unnecessary expressions should be avoided. 
- Passive sentences should be used to indicate that the study can be reproduced by anyone.
- Use LaTeX format
- When adding references (to literature, tables, or figures) will enhance the quality of the paper, please insert a placeholder using this LaTeX command `\hlref{XXX}`. This command will highlight any unlinked content so that it will work well as a placeholder.
