# !!! IMPORTANT !!!! 

## DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY)

1. Extract common code into functions or modules
2. Use variables for repeated values
3. Create templates for similar structures
4. Leverage inheritance and composition
5. Use configuration files for repeated settings

## Variants

1. WET (Write Everything Twice) - acceptable for rapid prototyping
2. DAMP (Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases) - prioritize readability over strict DRY
3. Rule of Three - refactor only after third repetition
