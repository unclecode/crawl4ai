# Start Small: An Iterative Approach to Development

Start development from small, isolated components before integrating them into a large codebase. This iterative approach fosters clearer design, easier debugging, and more robust systems.

## Define a Minimal Viable Component (MVC)
Before tackling a large problem, identify the smallest, independent piece of functionality that can be built and tested in isolation. This might be a single function, a small module, or a self-contained class.

## Prototype and Experiment
Use this MVC to experiment with different approaches, algorithms, or data structures. It's much faster to iterate and fail on a small scale.

## Thoroughly Test the MVC
Ensure the small component is fully functional, well-tested, and robust before expanding its scope. This means writing comprehensive unit tests that cover expected behavior and edge cases.

## Validate and Refine
Once the MVC is solid, integrate it into a slightly larger context. Continuously validate its performance and correctness.

## Scale Incrementally
Avoid "big bang" integrations. Gradually combine working, small components into larger systems, testing at each step. This significantly reduces the risk of introducing widespread bugs.
