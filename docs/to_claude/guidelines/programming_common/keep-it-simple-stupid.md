## BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
Since humans, at least I, cannot understand large amount of outputs, AI agents MUST MINIMIZE THEIR ANSWERS AS MUCH SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.

## Script Length
Avoid long scripts.
EACH SCRIPT (e.g., *.py, *.el, *.sh) MUST NOT EXCEED 300 lines of code.
Otherwise, build modularized, structured codebase.

## Your Understanding Check
